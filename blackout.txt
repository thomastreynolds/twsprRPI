#
#   The timestamp format is "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", for example "2022-10-02 16:46:00".
#       The '-' and the ':' are required, with a space between date and time.
#     Always local time, not UTC.
#   The first timestamp is start time, then a comma, then stop time.
#   The program check the first character of each line for a '#', indicating a
#       comment.  It will then stop after reading the first timestamp set.  If the
#       stop time has passed it will rewrite this file, eliminating that line.
